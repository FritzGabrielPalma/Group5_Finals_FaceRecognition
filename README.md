H&M, short for Hennes & Mauritz, is a Swedish multinational fashion retailer renowned for its fast-fashion approach and affordable, trendy clothing. Established in 1947, the brand has grown into one of the world's largest and most recognizable fashion retailers, with a vast global presence. H&M is celebrated for its ability to swiftly translate runway trends into accessible and stylish pieces for the mass market. The company is committed to sustainability, with initiatives such as garment recycling and the use of organic materials. H&M's diverse product range spans clothing, accessories, and footwear, making fashion accessible to a broad demographic while consistently adapting to evolving style preferences.


For this task, the group is tasked to develop a face recognition program that can identify both unknown and known faces. This activity must be aligned with the past activity that this made of making an interactive Dashboard for the brand of H&M or Hennes and Mauritz. The group is to identify faces that are wearing H&M products, as well as those faces that are unknown but still wearing H&M.

The group used the following codes provided below:

> Provided below is a Python code that performs face recognition on an image using the face_recognition library and OpenCV. It loads an unknown image, detects faces, and compares their encodings with a set of known face encodings. The code then draws rectangles around recognized faces, annotates them with corresponding names, and displays the modified image, showcasing the results of the face recognition process.

Face recognition is a biometric technology that identifies or verifies individuals by analyzing and matching their facial features. The process involves face detection, capturing facial images, extracting distinctive features, and comparing them with pre-stored data in a database. It is used for various applications, including security, access control, and user authentication. While face recognition offers non-intrusive and convenient solutions, privacy and data security concerns have been raised due to its potential for misuse and unauthorized surveillance.
